Developing secure PHP applications involves following best practices throughout the development lifecycle. Here are some essential coding practices to enhance the security of your PHP applications:

1. Validate and sanitize input: Always validate and sanitize user input to prevent common vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and code injection. Use appropriate filtering and validation functions like `filter_input()` and `htmlspecialchars()`.

2. Use parameterized queries or prepared statements: When interacting with databases, utilize parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection attacks. These techniques ensure that user input is treated as data rather than executable code.

3. Avoid direct user input in queries: Refrain from directly incorporating user input into SQL queries. Instead, use parameterized queries or escape user input using functions like `mysqli_real_escape_string()`.

4. Implement proper error handling: Avoid displaying detailed error messages to end users, as they can provide potential attackers with valuable information about your application. Instead, log errors to a secure location and present generic error messages to users.

5. Enforce strong passwords and authentication: Implement secure password storage by using hashing algorithms like bcrypt or Argon2. Enforce strong password policies, including complexity requirements and periodic password changes. Utilize secure authentication mechanisms like OAuth or two-factor authentication (2FA) where appropriate.

6. Protect against cross-site scripting (XSS): Use output encoding functions like `htmlspecialchars()` or content security policies (CSP) to mitigate the risk of XSS attacks. Be cautious when outputting user-generated content and sanitize it appropriately.

7. Implement access controls and authorization: Enforce access controls to ensure that only authorized users can access sensitive resources or perform specific actions. Utilize roles and permissions, and validate user privileges on the server-side.

8. Protect against cross-site request forgery (CSRF): Implement CSRF protection mechanisms such as using CSRF tokens and checking the Referer header. This helps prevent unauthorized requests from being executed on behalf of authenticated users.

9. Secure session management: Use secure session management techniques, such as generating unique session IDs, setting session timeouts, and regenerating session IDs after authentication. Store session data securely and avoid storing sensitive information in cookies.

10. Keep PHP and libraries up to date: Regularly update PHP to the latest stable version and ensure that any third-party libraries or frameworks you use are also up to date. Newer versions often include security patches that address vulnerabilities.

11. Implement input/output filtering: Filter and validate both incoming and outgoing data to prevent potential security risks. Use appropriate functions and libraries for input validation, such as `filter_var()`.

12. Secure file handling: Validate file uploads, restrict file types, and store uploaded files in a secure location outside the web root directory. Perform server-side checks on file types and scan uploaded files for potential threats.

13. Implement secure coding practices: Follow secure coding guidelines, such as avoiding hardcoded passwords or sensitive information, properly securing API keys and credentials, and avoiding the use of deprecated or insecure functions.

14. Use HTTPS and secure communication: Utilize HTTPS (SSL/TLS) to encrypt data transmission between the server and clients. This protects sensitive information from interception and ensures data integrity.

15. Regularly perform security testing: Conduct regular security assessments, penetration testing, and code reviews to identify vulnerabilities. Utilize automated tools and engage security experts to assess the security of your application.

Remember, security is an ongoing process. Stay updated with the latest security practices, maintain a robust development workflow, and prioritize security at every stage of your PHP application's lifecycle.
